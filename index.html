<h1>Hello, my name is Shakir Hossain</h1>
<p>I love most things that are tech-related such as computer programming, video editting, graphic design, electronic music, video games, etc.
I complement my passion for technology with my passion for Environmental Studies as shown by my years of dedication towards conserving the environment. 
I believe that the Environment can benefit from the use of technology, an example being the use of arcGIS to analyze forest data. 
I would like to utilize my computer science knowledge in order to help better preserve the environment.</p>
